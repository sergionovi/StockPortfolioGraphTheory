# Stock Portfolio Graph Theory #

Stock Portfolio Graph Theory is a personal project that aims to apply graph-theoretical approaches to create a robust stock portfolio based on the Bovespa components (Brazillian Financial Markets).

Initial plan: 
* Data collection;
* Data Cleanning
* Graph/network construction;   
* Community detection;
* Within Community Analysis. 


# Status:

The project is unfinished, but it is progressing well! Stay tuned!

Data collection is Done! :) 

Data Cleaning just started! I will use a deep neural network for the removal of outliers... This is likely not the best option, but the main idea is to get in touch with LSTM models through Keras and Tensor flow. 

# Organization:

* DataCollection.py: Python code for downloading historical data. It does web Scrapping and saves a csv file with stock data for further analysis.  
* Abnormal Detection: LSTM implemented in Python with TensorFlow to remove outliers from stock time series.
