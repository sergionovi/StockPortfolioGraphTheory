# Stock Portfolio Graph Theory #

Stock Portfolio Graph Theory is a personal project that aims to apply graph-theoretical approaches to create a robust stock portfolio based on the Bovespa components (Brazillian Financial Markets).

Initial plan: 
* Data collection;
* Graph/network construction;   
* Community detection;
* Within Community Analysis. 


# Status:

The project is unfinished, but it is progressing well! Stay tuned!

Data collection is Done! :) 

Data Cleaning just started! I will use a deep neural network for the removal of outliers... I am excited with this project!

# Organization:

* DataCollection.py: Python code for downloading historical data. It does web Scrapping and saves a csv file with stock data for further analysis.
